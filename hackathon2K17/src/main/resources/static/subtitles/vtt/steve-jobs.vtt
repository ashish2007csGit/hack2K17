1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.360
people say it you have a lot of passion for what you doing

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.790
and it's fully true the reason this

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.570
ah

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.060
is because it's so hard

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.440
if you don't

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.350
any rational person would give up

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.150
it's really hard

8
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.760
and you have to do it over a sustained period time

9
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.710
so if you don't want it

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320
here i have a fondue and you don't really love it

11
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.170
by the year to give up

12
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.750
that's what happens to most people actually doing with it

13
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.540
at at the ones that

14
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.630
i cannot

15
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.540
you be successful on hold the eyes of society in ones

16
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.220
often times it gets

17
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.480
the ones that are successful launch what they did so they can persevere

18
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.350
would you know we got we talk

19
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.110
yeah and then once did

20
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.170
didn't wanna

21
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.060
quiet

22
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.250
'cause are saying

23
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.920
like what put up with this that'd be a lot

24
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.060
so it's a lot of hard work

25
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.410
can get it's a lot worrying constantly

26
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.220
yeah nah

27
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.570
if you don't love it

28
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.330
you fail

29
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.160
so you got a lot would not have passion

30
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.230
and i think that's the higher worded the second thing is

31
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.090
calm

32
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.670
you gotta be

33
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.740
you gotta be a really good talent scout

34
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.990
is the matter how smart you are

35
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.170
you need a team of great people

36
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.370
can you gotta figure out

37
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.480
haven't had a size people up really quickly make decisions without knowing people too well

38
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.020
can hire them and you see on t v one refine your intuition

39
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.230
and be able to

40
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.900
to help you know build an organization that can

41
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.720
usually just

42
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.890
you build itself

43
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.940
jeannie great people and
