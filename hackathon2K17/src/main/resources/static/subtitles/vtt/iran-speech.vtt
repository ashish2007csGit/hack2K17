1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.670
today i fell to two years of negotiations

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.330
united states

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.430
together we're international partners

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.220
cheap something the decades of animosity has not

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.810
comprehensive long term deal

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.010
with the wrong warp or bennett

7
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.720
from obtaining a nuclear weapon

8
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.910
this deal demonstrates that american diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
change that makes our country i am a world safer more secure

10
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.610
those deals also in line with a tradition of american leadership

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630
it's now more than fifty years as president kennedy

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.470
the before the murder people i'm said

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.800
let us never negotiate out here but let us never fear

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.600
to negotiate

15
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.100
he was picking them about the need for discussions between the eyes states and soviet union

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.230
sweats efforts to restore it

17
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.860
read of nuclear weapons

18
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.930
most days of rest

19
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.400
was a catastrophic nuclear war between two superpowers

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.220
in our time the risk is that nuclear weapons will spread to more and more conflicts

21
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.950
certainly in the middle east

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.680
most volatile region

23
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.520
in our world

24
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.850
today

25
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.790
because america negotiated for my position of strength

26
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.560
principal

27
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.500
we have stop the spread of nuclear weapons in this region

28
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.090
cause of this beyond

29
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.340
the international community will be able to verify

30
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.040
the islamic republic of a lot will not develop

31
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.990
the nuclear weapon

32
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.340
does you'll meet every single one of the bomb wives we establish one week cheap if we work earlier this point

33
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480
every pathway to a nuclear weapon

34
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.160
come on

35
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.630
the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective

36
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.690
will be put in place

37
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.110
because of the steel rod will not reduce the high we reach your radium weapons were to talk him

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.500
form a raw materials necessary for a nuclear bomb

39
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.500
because of this your allotment were move

40
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.130
two thirds of it's installed centrifuges

41
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.270
the machines necessary to produce highly rich you rate him

42
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.160
for a ball

43
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.550
and store them

44
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.960
under constant international supervision

45
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.950
ron walmart use its event centrifuges to produce enrich your radio

46
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.990
for the next decade

47
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
rom also get rid of ninety eight percent of its stockpile of the rich

48
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.820
you're right

49
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.050
a better perspective rock for we have a stockpile the computers up to ten nuclear weapons

50
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.450
because of this deal

51
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.150
that stockpile will be reduced to a fraction

52
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.690
what would be required freezing weather

53
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.760
the stock politician will last

54
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.880
figures

55
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400
because of this bill rommel modifier

56
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.640
portage reactor in rock

57
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.290
snooker will mop

58
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.150
produce weapons grade plutonium

59
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.570
and it has agreed to ship the spent fuel from a reactor all of a comfortable life time of the react

60
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.690
for at least the next fifteen years

61
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.740
iran will not build any

62
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.380
new heavy water reactor

63
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.430
because of this deal we will for the first time in a position to verify all of these commitments

64
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.660
that means his view is not built on trust

65
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.990
it is built on turf cage

66
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.100
actors will have

67
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.630
forty four seven access to rods he knew group of soldiers

68
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.090
rommel have access to rods entire nuclear supply to

69
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.400
during a mile to males

70
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.810
conversion fizzled

71
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.590
then it's centrifuge manufacturing and storage the soul is

72
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.830
this ensures that are raw mob you would divert materials from north of seoul is

73
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.780
cool

74
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.260
some reassurance currency measures would be in place

75
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.680
forty five years

76
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.880
because of israel and specter's walls we want to access any suspicious location

77
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.710
put simply we organization responsible for the inspired

78
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.600
t i eighty eight

79
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.880
will have access were necessary

80
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.210
when masses are

81
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.880
that arrangement

82
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.670
palmer

83
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.140
and the i e eight

84
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.060
has also reached number him with iran to get taxes

85
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.280
but it needs to complete its investigation of a possible military dimension

86
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.920
rods

87
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.520
past research

88
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.580
while iran is formally prohibited from pursuing a nuclear weapon or the nuclear nonproliferation treaty

89
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420
which provided the basis for the international can use effort

90
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.250
like pressure on or off

91
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.170
as ron take steps to implement this new

92
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.870
you will receive only from the sanctions we put in place

93
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.880
cause of bronze know for for

94
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.200
all the murders on sanctions

95
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.790
and sanctions imposed by the united nations

96
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.750
three counts

97
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.010
we've we faced them

98
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.800
ramos complete

99
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.180
he knew where steps

100
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.000
ford biggest receive new sanctions wait

101
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.160
and over the course of the next decade

102
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.150
or wrong almost applied

103
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.100
why the deal

104
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.060
before additional sanctions or what

105
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.620
during five years for restrictions related to orange

106
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.090
and a years for restrictions related to blistered message

107
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.940
all this will be memorialized endorsed

108
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.900
a new united nations surgery council resolution

109
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.580
and of rock by what's the deal

110
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.030
all these sanctions will snap back into place

111
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.930
so there's a very clear incentive for rob fall through

112
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.770
and there are very real consequences

113
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.860
for your mileage

114
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.410
that's the beat

115
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.610
it has the full backing of the international community

116
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.810
i was well have

117
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.040
not to read reviews the details of my best version stairs rage provide expensive briefings

118
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.860
on how this will move forward

119
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.460
every market to boycott worst movie of the deal

120
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.620
you will be important to consider the alternative

121
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.460
consider what happens in the world

122
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.620
without this deal

123
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.710
about this deal there is no scenario where the world joins

124
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.140
in sanctioning them wrong

125
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.100
to look completely dismantles

126
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.340
its nuclear program

127
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.850
driving we know about iranian government suggest that would simply capitulate on the back on russia

128
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.940
in the world would not support an effort to permit recession or on into submission

129
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.080
put sanctions and place to get a diplomatic resolution

130
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.810
that is what we've got

131
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.140
without this rio de would be no grip on tissues for the iranian nuclear program

132
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.950
rock to produce operate

133
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.810
test more more centrifuges

134
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.270
record

135
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.530
fuel a reactor capable of producing plutonium for bomb

136
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.260
there we would not have any of the inspections were lost

137
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.210
to detect

138
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.210
covert nuclear weapons program

139
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.350
in other words

140
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.580
no no means a no lasting come spring summer ron's nuclear power

141
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.350
just a narrow would make it more likely

142
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.050
but other countries new region feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear power

143
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.720
trimming a nuclear arms race the most volatile region of the world

144
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.930
we're also presented states with fewer

145
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.490
unless effect of options

146
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.900
for better or ron from trading

147
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.720
the nuclear work

148
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.940
i've been present income energy

149
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.130
for for six years now

150
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.490
time again i've faced decisions about whether or not to use motor force

151
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.140
when this assertion that the present estimate

152
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.720
many times

153
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.100
in multiple conflicts

154
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.340
i have decided to use force

155
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.750
i'll never hesitate to do so when it is in our national search for him first

156
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.500
i strongly believe

157
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.670
our national scurry interest

158
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.330
now

159
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.310
hands up on renting a lot from obtaining a nuclear weapon

160
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.760
which means good without a diplomatic resolution

161
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.790
i drive

162
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.320
for a future us pres

163
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.970
they say decision about whether or not to allow wrong

164
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.470
during a nuclear weapon

165
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.700
warm weather to use our military

166
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.790
it's employed

167
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.110
no deal means a greater chance

168
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.990
of war war

169
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.000
the least

170
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.760
moreover we give

171
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.250
testing whether or not this problem can be solved peacefully

172
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.530
if

173
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.270
and worse case scenario wrong violates the deal

174
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.380
the same options for bill walton me today will be available to any us president in the future

175
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.570
i've no doubt

176
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.110
ten or fifteen years from now

177
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.040
person who hold this office

178
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.820
will be in a far stronger position

179
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.230
with a rock

180
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.540
further where where where

181
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.860
him with the inspections and transparency that allow us to monitor

182
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.150
the rhyme for

183
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.990
for this reason

184
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.740
i believe it would be your response off

185
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.290
to walk away from israel

186
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.130
but

187
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.420
on such a tough issue

188
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.440
it is important to be murdered people and representatives and timers

189
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.590
get a full option you were viewed you

190
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.330
for all the details matter

191
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.080
we've heads of the finest nuclear scientists in the world

192
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.000
walking through those details

193
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.630
and we're dealing with a comfort

194
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.090
or wrong that has been a swarm ever serbia by the states for over thirty five years

195
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.090
so i walk

196
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:19.360
a robust debate in congress on this issue and i welcome screen of the details of disagreement

197
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.430
but i will call my cars

198
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.230
the dome ideals wonders with your friends

199
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.640
we negotiated arms control rooms with the soviet union one that nation was committed to war destruction

200
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.730
and those women saltzman we made a sec

201
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.190
i am confident that this deal will meet

202
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.390
the nationals korean first of the night states

203
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.700
and our allies

204
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.390
swallow big toe

205
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.570
any legislation that prevents

206
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.340
the successful implementation

207
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.110
others view

208
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.820
we do not have to accept

209
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.260
and ever will spiral into conflict

210
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.540
murray's serve mushrooms a kid

211
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.930
precisely because the stakes are so hot

212
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.290
this is not the time for politics

213
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.370
posture

214
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.120
top washington does not so props

215
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.280
for those diplomas

216
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.560
leadership that as you might have been the world's major powers

217
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.540
offers are more fact of what a verified

218
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.870
but ron is not pursuing nuclear weapon

219
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.560
now

220
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.460
that doesn't mean that his view was all all of our differences with the rock

221
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.330
we share the existence or verge rus by many of our friends i'm a waste

222
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.070
klingons rwanda goals

223
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.530
but alonso support for terrorism

224
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.050
managers of rock singers

225
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.340
to be stabilize the region

226
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.190
that is precisely why we are taking the step

227
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:47.920
because we're wrong on with nuclear weapon would be far more to stabilizing and far more dangerous to our friends

228
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.870
and to the world

229
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.650
meanwhile we will maintain our

230
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.830
holmes sections way to run support for terrorism

231
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.990
ballistic missile program and human rights violations

232
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.920
we will continue

233
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.390
press and efforts

234
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.030
to strengthen

235
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.100
goodwill surgery

236
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.270
towards the goal beyond what any murder much friction is done before

237
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.870
and we will continue to work we began a gambit

238
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.380
to elevate our partnership with the gulf states

239
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.310
the strength and

240
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.960
their capabilities to cover threats from rom or terrorist groups like isis

241
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.770
farmer i believe it

242
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.390
we must continue to test

243
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.340
whether or not

244
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:25.950
this region

245
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.290
which is mom so much softly

246
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.820
so much watch it

247
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.360
to move

248
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.400
in a different direction

249
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.840
time again i've made clear to the iranian people

250
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.680
there we

251
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.450
always be open to engagement on the basis of

252
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.310
full interests

253
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.650
a mutual respect

254
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.260
our differences are real

255
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.260
and of course history between our nations cannot be ignored

256
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.460
it is possible to change

257
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.130
half of violence

258
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.410
and rigid ideology

259
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.540
for pulsing based on threats to attack her neighbors were wrecking his room

260
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.280
tibetans

261
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.110
the different era

262
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.660
talks

263
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.820
for resolution of conflict

264
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.520
leads to more integration into the pool or comic

265
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.930
more engagement with the international community

266
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.400
in the ability of iranian people

267
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.300
prosper

268
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.920
the steel offers an opportunity to move

269
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.060
in a new direction

270
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.200
we should seize it

271
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.130
come along way to reach this point

272
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.600
decades of rotting nuclear program

273
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.500
many years of sanctions

274
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.930
and many months of intense negotiation

275
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.200
today a lot back

276
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.430
the members of congress fumble tories who helped us put in place the sanctions that have proven sole factor

277
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.330
as was the other countries who joined as a matter of

278
